    "\n",
    "This notebook creates realistic conversations between AI teachers and students. It's like having different types of teachers talk to different types of students about school subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What This Does\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reads Educational Materials**: Takes textbooks or lesson materials and understands what they're about\n",
    "2. **Creates AI Teachers & Students**: Makes different teacher personalities (strict, friendly, etc.) and student types (focused, creative, etc.)\n",
    "3. **Generates Conversations**: Has these AI characters talk to each other about the lesson topics\n",
    "4. **Saves the Conversations**: Records everything so it can be turned into audio later\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cool Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Different Student Types**: Some are good at math, others are creative, some need more help\n",
    "- **Different Teacher Styles**: Some are encouraging, others ask tough questions, some tell stories\n",

    "1. **Find Topic Boundaries**: Knows when one topic ends and another begins\n",

    "You are also additionally tasked to provide a single unifying title for all the topics, which should be a concise summary of the overall content.\n",

    "1. Split only when there is a significant shift in subject or focus.\n",

    "4. Group together contextual or background information that supports a larger subject area.\n",
    "5. Avoid over-splitting; favor fewer, robust sections that capture the overall theme.\n",

The topics should be neither as broad as an entire module (e.g., \"Physics\" or \"Projectile Motion\") nor as narrow as a single detailed discussion (e.g., \"Analysis of One Equation\"). Each topic should represent a well-defined lesson that is clear, organized, and substantial.\n",
    "7. Each topic is intended to serve as the basis of an assessment, so ensure that the content is broad and detailed enough to generate at least 5 meaningful questions.\n",
    "8. Ensure that the topic title itself is not phrased as a question (e.g., avoid titles like \"Advantages of X\").\n",
    "9. Avoid too many subtopics, as they can lead to confusion. Instead, focus on creating a few well-defined topics that cover the material comprehensively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each topic section:\n",
    "- Create a concise title (3–5 words) that reflects the main subject.\n",

Your role is to guide the student through the assessment, encouraging them to think critically and helping them when needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions for Conducting the Assessment:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ask Questions Clearly:  \n",
    "- Present each main question one at a time from the given questions.  \n",
    "- Format the question in a conversational tone suitable for verbal reading.  \n",
    "- Ensure mathematical expressions are written in full English (e.g., “Alpha times x squared equals four” instead of “ax^2 = 4”). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Validate Answers Based on Criteria:  \n",
    "- When the student provides an answer, check if it meets the criteria.  \n",
    "- The provided answer in the assessment data is a verified example, but not the only correct answer.  \n",
    "- If the student gives an answer that aligns with the criteria, acknowledge it positively and move to the next question.  \n",
    "- If the answer is incorrect or incomplete, select an appropriate follow-up question to guide them toward the right answer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Follow-Up Questions:  \n",
    "- Clearly distinguish between a main question and a follow-up question.  \n",
    "- Use follow-ups only if the student’s answer does not fully meet the criteria.  \n",
    "- Encourage critical thinking instead of simply giving away the answer.  \n",
    "- If the student is struggling, provide hints or rephrase the question for clarity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Handling Uncertainty:  \n",
    "- If the student says they do not know the answer, gently nudge them with a hint.  \n",
    "- Example: If the question is “What is the capital of France?” and they are unsure, say:  \n",
    "  - “Think of a famous city known for the Eiffel Tower.”  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Concluding the Assessment:  \n",
    "- Once all main questions have been answered, give a warm and encouraging goodbye message.  \n",
    "- The goodbye message must contain the phrase “Good Bye” explicitly.  \n",
    "- Example:  \n",
    "  - “Great job today! You’ve done well in this assessment. Keep practicing and learning. Good Bye!”  \n",
    "\n",
    "Response Formatting Example:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Main Question:  \n",
    "“What is the square root of sixteen?”  \n",
    "\n",
    "Student’s Incorrect Response:  \n",
    "\"Maybe five?\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "Follow-Up Question:  \n",
    "“That’s close, but not quite! Try thinking of a number that, when multiplied by itself, gives sixteen.”  \n",
    "\n",
    "Student’s Correct Response:  \n",
    "\"Oh, it’s four!\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "AI Response:  \n",
    "\"That’s absolutely right! The square root of sixteen is four. Let’s move on to the next question.\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "At all times, be patient, encouraging, and adaptable to the student's responses. Now, begin the assessment with the following assessment data: {{assessment_data}}."

    "\n",
    "### Making Every Teacher Talk to Every Student\n",
    "\n",
    "This section creates conversations between every teacher type and every student type. It's like having a big classroom where every teacher gets to work with every student.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What We're Creating:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **8 Different Teachers**: Each with their own style (strict, friendly, etc.)\n",
    "- **9 Different Students**: Each with their own personality and ability level\n",
    "- **72 Total Conversations**: Every possible teacher-student combination\n",
    "- **Same Questions**: All conversations use the questions from our lesson material\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Goes Through Everyone**: Creates conversations systematically for all combinations\n",
    "2. **Saves Each One**: Every conversation gets saved as its own file\n",
    "3. **Tracks Progress**: Shows you how many are done and how many are left\n",
    "4. **Handles Problems**: If one conversation fails, it keeps going with the others\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How We Organize the Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clear File Names**: Each file is named like `conversation_teacher_1_student_3.csv`\n",
    "- **Includes Info**: Each file shows which teacher and student personalities were used\n",
    "- **Easy to Read**: Saved in a simple format that's easy to analyze\n",
    "- **Ready for Audio**: Formatted so it can easily be turned into speech"

    "## Step 9: Making Questions Match Teacher Personalities\n",
    "\n",
    "### Personalizing How Teachers Ask Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "This section improves the system by making each teacher ask questions in their own unique way. Instead of all teachers asking the same question the same way, each one phrases it according to their personality.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What We're Improving:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Personal Question Style**: Each teacher asks questions in their own way\n",
    "2. **Natural Communication**: Questions sound like they really come from that type of teacher\n",
    "3. **Consistent Teaching**: Teachers stick to their style throughout the conversation\n",
    "4. **Same Voice**: Each teacher maintains their personality in every interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How We Do This:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rewrite Questions**: Have each teacher rephrase the same question in their style\n",
    "- **Keep It Accurate**: Don't change the meaning, just the way it's asked\n",
    "- **Do It for Everyone**: Create personalized versions for all teacher types\n",
    "- **Use Later**: Integrate these personalized questions into future conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why This Makes Things Better:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **More Realistic**: Conversations sound more like real teacher-student interactions\n",
    "- **Better Engagement**: Students respond better when questions match the teacher's style\n",
    "- **Better Audio**: When converted to speech, it sounds more natural\n",
    "- **More Variety**: Creates a richer collection of different ways to ask the same thing"

    "#### What Should Happen:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Varied Conversations**: Each student will have a different conversation pattern\n",
    "- **Consistent Teacher**: The teacher maintains their questioning style with all students\n",
    "- **Good Teaching**: The teacher provides appropriate help for each student's level\n",
    "- **High Quality**: The conversations should be good enough to use in real educational apps"
