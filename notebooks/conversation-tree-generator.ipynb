    "# Conversation Tree with Audio Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook processes educational conversations from CSV files and generates interactive conversation trees with AI-generated audio using the Kokoro text-to-speech model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook performs the following steps:\n",
    "1. **Data Processing**: Reads conversation CSV files and creates a structured conversation tree\n",
    "2. **Audio Generation**: Uses Kokoro TTS to generate audio files for each dialogue turn\n",
    "3. **Link Integration**: Adds audio download links to the conversation tree structure\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites & Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Dependencies\n",
    "- Python packages: `kokoro`, `soundfile`, `numpy`, `spacy`\n",
    "- spaCy English model: `en_core_web_sm`\n",

    "1. **Initializes Kokoro TTS**: Sets up the neural text-to-speech pipeline\n",
    "2. **Configures voice mapping**: Assigns different voices to teachers and students\n",
    "   - Teachers: `af_heart` (female voice)\n",
    "   - Students: `am_puck` (male pre-teen voice)\n",
    "3. **Processes the conversation tree**: Recursively traverses all dialogue nodes\n",
    "4. **Generates audio files**: Creates `.wav` files for each tagged dialogue turn\n",
    "5. **Handles errors gracefully**: Continues processing even if individual files fail\n",
    "\n",
    "### Voice Configuration:\n",
    "- **Teacher voice**: `af_heart` - Professional female voice for educators\n",
    "- **Student voice**: `am_puck` - Younger male voice for student responses\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "- Audio files saved to `audio/` directory\n",
    "- Files named using the unique tags from the conversation tree (e.g., `teacher_1_student_2_question_1_0001.wav`)"

    "## Step 3: Audio Link Integration\n",

    "After generating the audio files, you need to upload them to a Hugging Face dataset repository to make them publicly accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Manual Upload Process:\n",
    "1. **Upload audio files** to a Hugging Face dataset repository\n",
    "2. **Preserve filenames** - ensure the uploaded files keep their original names\n",
    "3. **Update the base URL** in the code below to match your repository\n",
    "4. **Run the integration code** to add download links to the conversation tree\n",
    "\n",
    "### What the integration code does:\n",
    "- **Adds audio links**: Inserts download URLs for each tagged dialogue turn\n",
    "- **Preserves structure**: Maintains the original conversation tree hierarchy\n",
    "- **Creates enhanced JSON**: Outputs a new file with embedded audio links\n",
    "- **Uses direct download URLs**: Links include `?download=true` for immediate access\n"
